# event-horizon
- Smart routing to bridge assets from mainnet to layer 2s and possibly back to mainnet
- single click to bridge multiple assets at the same time


# considerations
- would be nice to have as a cli in addition to a frontend
- optimize for cost initially but might need to enable users to specify additional preferences such as time once briding back to mainnet is available
- is there a way to do this that's privacy preserving (e.g. something akin to Tornado?)
